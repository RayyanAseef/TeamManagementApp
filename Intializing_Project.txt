Client Folder: This is for the frontend development using react.js
Server Folder: This is for the backend development using node.js + express
Database: Using MySQL

Run Server: npm start

Database:
 - In MySQL Create a Database for our project. The rest of the changes will be done through node.js + express

Backend:
- Install package.json and the others on server folder by: npm init
  \-> This is practically like settings.py in Django 

- Install required libraries by: npm install express cors mysql2
  \-> Express is just part of backedn with node.js
  \-> Cors is to link fronend and backend
  \-> MySQL is the database 

- For automatic server updates install: npm install nodemon
  \-> Add this to the scripts tag in package.json: "start": "nodemon index.js"

- For easier handling of MySQL database: npm insall sequelize sequelize-cli
  \-> After: sequelize init
  \-> The models folder is where out database tables models will be created. A seperate js file for each model.
  \-> To link to database open configs folder and update database credientials.

- To create urls we need to create a routes folder in server
  \-> These files will create the route and handle post and get requests.


Index.js File:
- This is where we create the web app
- Link all the routes from the routes folder
- Add all the tables from the models folder

Frontend:
- To create react app: npx create-react-app .
